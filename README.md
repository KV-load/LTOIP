# LTOIP (Language translation over internet protocol)

## Problem:-
How many times we visit new places and when we want to talk to someone ex: our uber car we are not able to understand him, and vice-versa.
Which I also felt while booking cabs in chennai.

## Solution:- 
So for this I want to create this peice of software which while talking to someone on call or in realtime will translate each other language in the flow.
